# Data tidying

```{r}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
```

## Learning objectives

- Classify datasets as **tidy** or **non-tidy.**
- **Pivot** data to make it tidy.
- Recognize reasons for **non-tidy data**.

Apart from the book content, these slides also borrow from [`vignette("pivot", "tidyr")`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html) and contain some new diagrams.

## Tidy data: what?

![](images/6-tidy-1.png)

- **variables** are the **columns**
- **observations** are the **rows**
- **values** are the **cells**

**`<meaningful things>`** are in **`<places>`**

## Tidy data: why?

- packages in the **tidyverse** are designed to work with **tidy data**
  - hence tidy data allow to focus on the data questions
- placing variables in **columns** allows to take advantage of R’s **vectorized** nature

## An example (1)

```{r}
#| include: false

table0 <- table1 |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = c(cases, population),
  )
```

```{r}
table0
```

## An example (2)

```{r}
table1
```

## An example (3)

```{r}
table2
```

## Which example dataframe was tidy?

## Which example dataframe was tidy?

```{r}
table1
```

## The challenge (1)

- most real data is **untidy**: to facilitate some goal other than analysis
- so you often need to **tidy** the original data. This takes two steps:
  1. determine the underlying variables and observations
  1. pivot your data into a tidy form

## The challenge (2)

It may be difficult to define what a variable is, especially if you miss context.

- e.g. columns `measurement_1` and `measurement_2`: replicates of the same variable, or referring to different methods / states?

If you cannot figure out, then it’s fine to say a variable is whatever makes your **analysis** easiest.


## Two different scenarios (1)

1. 'too wide' is most common: _values_ (of a variable) have ended up _in **column names**_
    - tidy by making the data **longer**: pivot these values into their own column (variable)
    
## Too wide

```{r}
table4a # only has the 'cases', not the 'population'
```

## Two different scenarios (2)

1. 'too wide' is most common: _values_ (of a variable) have ended up _in **column names**_
    - tidy by making the data **longer**: pivot these values into their own column (variable)
    
1. 'too long' is less common: _names_ of several variables exist as _**cells in one column**_, their values in another
    - tidy by making the data **wider**: pivot the column with variable names into several columns (variables)
    
## Too long

```{r}
table2
```

## Tidy your data (1)

- Make too wide data **longer** with `tidyr::pivot_longer()`.
- Make too long data **wider** with `tidyr::pivot_wider()`.

We'll focus on the relationship between both functions in different situations.

## Tidy your data (2)

Most function arguments contain the strings `names` or `values`:

- **`names`**: refers to **variable** whose _values_ generate **column names** in **wide** table
- **`values`**: refers to **variable** whose _values_ generate **cells** in **wide** table

These arguments always get the **name** of the corresponding variable in the **long** table!

## 1. One `names` variable and one `values` variable

![](images/5_diagram_1.png)

## Example

```{r}
table4a
table_tidy <- 
  table4a |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !country,
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "cases"
  )
table_tidy
```

```{r}
table_tidy |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = cases
  )
```

## 2. Multiple `names` variables and one `values` variable

![](images/5_diagram_2.png)

## Example

```{r}
#| include: false

perc_wide <- tibble(
  "2018_A" = 100, 
  "2018_B" = 0, 
  "2019_A" = 0, 
  "2019_B" = 100, 
  "2020_A" = 40, 
  "2020_B" = 60
)
```

```{r}
perc_wide
perc_tidy <- perc_wide |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(),
    names_to = c("year", "type"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "percentage"
  )
perc_tidy
perc_tidy |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(year, type),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_from = percentage
  )
```

## Intermezzo: missing values (1)

```{r}
billboard
```

```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank"
  )
```

## Intermezzo: missing values (2)

Notice the effect of `values_drop_na` in `pivot_longer()`!

```{r}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```


## Intermezzo: missing values (3)

```{r}
#| include: false

weekdays <- c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")
daily <- tibble(
  day = factor(c("Tue", "Thu", "Fri", "Mon"), levels = weekdays),
  value = c(2, 3, 1, 5)
)
```

Suppose we have a factor variable `day`:

```{r}
daily
levels(daily$day)
```

Now you want a wide table including missing values for the absent factor levels.

Does this work?

```{r}
daily |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = value
  )
```

Obviously not.


## Intermezzo: missing values (4)

Notice the effect of `names_expand` in `pivot_wider()`!

```{r}
daily |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = value,
    names_expand = TRUE
  )
```


## Intermezzo: missing values (5)

Remember this example:

```{r}
perc_tidy
```

```{r}
perc_wide
```

## Intermezzo: missing values (6)

Suppose we have this, and you want to make it **wide** and add **zeros**, not `NA`s:

```{r}
#| include: false

percentages <- tibble(
  year = c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2020),
  type = factor(c("A", "B", "A", "B"), levels = c("A", "B")),
  percentage = c(100, 100, 40, 60)
)
```

```{r}
percentages
percentages |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(year, type),
    values_from = percentage
  )
```

That's not it...

## Intermezzo: missing values (7)

Notice the effect of `names_expand` and `values_fill` in `pivot_wider()`!

```{r}
percentages |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = c(year, type),
    values_from = percentage,
    names_expand = TRUE,
    values_fill = 0
  )
```


## Recap

So far we had:

1. One `names` variable and one `values` variable
1. Multiple `names` variables and one `values` variable

Plus tricks to generate missing values or deal with them.

Let's consider two more situations:

3. The `values` variable's name is included in the wide-table's column names
4. Multiple `values` variables' names are included in the wide-table's column names

## 3. The `values` variable's name is included in the wide-table's column names

![](images/5_diagram_3.png)

## Example

We take the example from the first situation, but with the name of the `values` variable included in the wide table:

```{r}
#| include: false

cases <- table_tidy |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = cases,
    names_glue = "{.value}_{year}"
  )
```

```{r}
cases
```

We can now extract this name _instead_ of defining it with `values_to`:

```{r}
cases_long <- cases |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !country,
    names_to = c(".value", "year"),
    names_sep = "_"
  )
cases_long
identical(cases_long, table_tidy)
```

Recreate the wide table:

```{r}
cases_long |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = cases,
    names_glue = "{.value}_{year}"
  )
```



## 4. Multiple `values` variables' names are included in the wide-table's column names

![](images/5_diagram_4.png)

## Example

```{r}
household
household_tidy <- household |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !family,
    names_to = c(".value", "child"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
household_tidy
household_tidy |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = child,
    values_from = c(dob, name),
    names_glue = "{.value}_{child}"
  )
```


## There's more!

See [book chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy) and especially the [vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html)!

- drop or add a (wide-table) column name prefix with the `names_prefix` argument
- drop 'id' columns (i.e. non-pivoted columns) in `pivot_wider()` with the `id_cols` argument
- generate rows with missing values in `pivot_wider()` with the `id_expand` argument
- aggregating values in `pivot_wider()`
- combining `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` for more complex situations
- for more complex cases, instead of `names_*` and `values_*` arguments, you can construct a single specification dataframe that you can provide to both `pivot_longer_spec()` and `pivot_wider_spec()`
- and more

00:12:06	Becki R. (she/her):	Hello!
00:14:06	Susie N:	You could also just do as.numeric correct?
00:14:09	Susie N:	Just not as nice
00:19:26	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Yup, the convert just figures out the as.* for you automatically.
00:22:11	Keuntae Kim:	https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_01.html

00:55:00	Becki R. (she/her):	Thanks, Sandra!
00:55:36	Keuntae Kim:	In the wide-format, it is easy to produce additional derivative variables--such as percentages?
00:56:24	Keuntae Kim:	It is because, in the wide format, each row represents one single unique observation.
00:56:58	Keuntae Kim:	Census data
00:57:03	Keuntae Kim:	is organized in the wide format.
00:57:26	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Read vignettes here for cases where it makes sense to be wide: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/widyr/index.html
