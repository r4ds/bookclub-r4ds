## Introduction

## Learning objectives

After today's session, you will be able to...

- Describe a *typical* data science project.
- Explain the reasoning behind the order of content in this book.
- Recognize topics that are not covered by this book.
- Set up an environment in which you can learn the topics in this book.
- Describe how code in the book differs from code in your console.

## A typical data science project

![](images/data-science.png)

-   **Importing** + **tidying** = **wrangling** data
-   **Understanding** = cycle of **transforming, visualizing, modeling** 
-   **Communicating** your results to other humans
-   **Programming** aids entire process 
    -   Automate common tasks
    -   Solve new problems with greater ease.

## Import the data

-   **Import:** (file, database, web app) ‚û°Ô∏è R
    -   Can't data science it 'til it's in R!

## Wrangle the data

-   ü§† Tidying + transforming = ***wrangling*** 
    -   ü•ä Making data usable often feels like a fight.

-   **Tidy:** Consistent structure makes everything easier
    -   ‚Üï‚Üï‚ÜïÔ∏è Columns = variables
    -   ‚ÜîÔ∏è Rows = observations
-   **Transform:** Further refinement
    -   Filter (narrow in)
    -   Mutate (create new variables)
    -   Summarize (calculate things for groups)

## Understand & communicate

- **Visualize:** 
    -   Good dataviz can help find unexpected + raise new questions
    -   [ggplot2 book](http://ggplot2-book.org/) has more in-depth details
- **Model:** 
    -   Extract patterns from data
    -   Not covered in-depth here, see [tmwr.org](https://tmwr.org)
- **Communicate:** 
    -   Critical part of DS!
    -   It doesn't matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them.
    - ***Note:*** R4DS 2e focuses on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), vs [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) in 1e

## The order of content in this book

-   **Import** & **Tidy** = üò¥
    -   So jump to üìà **Visualization** & üîÅ **Transformation**
    -   *Then* **wrangle,** cuz necessary
-   **Programming** next
    -   Helps simplify other steps
-   Each chapter has **motivating examples**
    -   Bigger picture before details
-   **Exercises** woven in for practice
    -   ***Discuss: Do we want to walk through exercises?***

## Not covered by this book

-   **Modelling:** Super important for DS, but too big for this book
    -   [Tidy Modelling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn & Julia Silge (book club!)
-   **Big data:** Problem-specific
    -   If you work with big data, will want to learn other tools
    -   [{sparklyr}](https://therinspark.com/) builds on principles in this book
-   **Other programming languages:** (Python, Julia, etc.)
    -   Master 1 tool at a time
    -   Maybe go on to other tools later

## Prerequisites

-   Numeric literacy
-   Basic programming skills (but ok if you're brand new)
    -   [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by Garrett Grolemund =  useful corequisite for this book
-   **R:** Download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), the **c**omprehensive **R** **a**rchive **n**etwork
-   [**Rstudio:**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) integrated development environment (IDE) for R (and others)
    -   A useful [cheat sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html) for RStudio

## Prerequisites: Install these packages

-   üì¶ = collection of functions, data, & documentation
-   The [**tidyverse**](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) = üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶
    -   Shared philosophy (concept of this book)
    -   `install.packages("tidyverse")`
        -   [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/), [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [`lubridate`](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate), [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/), [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
-   Additional packages which provide interesting datasets
    -   When you see `Error in library(ggrepel) : there is no package called ‚Äòggrepel‚Äô`,
    -   Run `install.packages("ggrepel")`

## Conventions within the book: #>

Code in book slightly different from output you'll see

- `#>` in book = `>` in RStudio
    -   `#` = comment
    -   Can copy/paste code from book to console

```{r}
#| eval: false

1 + 2
#> [1] 3
```

## Conventions within the book: Code

-   Functions = `code font` + `()`
    -   `sum()` or `mean()`
-   Other R objects = `code font`
    -   `flights` or `x`
-   `dplyr::filter()` = "dplyr's filter"

## Bonus: Resources for getting help

-   **Pay attention to error messages.**
    -   Tidyverse error messages are often helpful
    -   If not enough, copy/paste into Google
-   **Stackoverflow.com** *can* also be helpful, but beware.
-   The [**Data Science Learning Community**](dslc.io/join) is a friendly Slack community with volunteer R tutors
    - Navigate to [dslc.io/join](dslc.io/join) to request access to our Slack
    -   If expired, email [rfordatasci@gmail.com](mailto:rfordatasci@gmail.com)

## Bonus: Reproducible examples

-   Make a [**reprex**](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) ("reproducible example")
    -   State what *packages* you use
        -   `library(dplyr)`, etc
    -   Provide (a subset of) any data you use with [`dput()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/dput)
    -   Try to make your code *easy to read* (clean spacing, clear variable names, comments)

## Meeting chat log
  
```
00:18:00	Morgan Grovenburg:	I have to leave early today. Also, I'd normally have my video on, but my kid is currently using me as a jungle gym
00:21:19	Susie Neilson:	Link to our team‚Äôs work :) https://www.sfchronicle.com/data/
00:22:40	Morgan Grovenburg:	I know what talk you're talking about
00:23:10	Wai-Yin:	Data journalism‚Äôs wikipedia article  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism
00:49:59	Ryan Metcalf:	Great question Susie! I consider ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù anything I can‚Äôt open in a conventional service. Using scripting languages helps with managing overhead (Cost [not monetary], time of process, processing capability, etc‚Ä¶).
01:00:14	Njoki Njuki Lucy:	data.table has the similar syntax as the base R package.
01:17:46	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	dslc.io/r4ds
