# Spreadsheets

**Learning objectives:**

- We are going to learn about the various ways in which we can get data out of a spread sheet or google sheet.

- We are going to learn how to write data from spread sheet and google sheet.

## Data Organization in Spreadsheets {-}
[Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) is a paper with some excellent tips:  
- Be Consistent  
- Choose Good Names for Things  
- Write Dates as YYYY-MM-DD  
- No Empty Cells  
- Put Just One Thing in a Cell  
- Make it a Rectangle  
- Create a Data Dictionary  
- No Calculations in the Raw Data Files  
- Do Not Use Font Color or Highlighting as Data  
- Make Backups  
- Use Data Validation to Avoid Errors  
- Save the Data in Plain Text Files  


## Excel {-}

Microsoft Excel is a widely used spreadsheet software program where data are organized in worksheets inside of spreadsheet files.

## Prerequisites {-}

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(writexl)
```

## Getting started {-}

Most of readxl’s functions allow you to load Excel spreadsheets into R:

- **read_xls()** reads Excel files with **xls** format.

- **read_xlsx()** read Excel files with **xlsx** format.

- **read_excel()** can read files with both **xls** and **xlsx** format. It guesses the file type based on the input.

## Reading Excel spreadsheets {-}

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-spreadsheets-students.png)

- read_excel() will read the file in as a tibble.

```{r}
students <- read_excel("data/students.xlsx")


students
```


## Column names {-} 
The column names are all over the place. We can provide column names that follow a consistent format; we recommend snake_case using the col_names argument.

```{r}
read_excel(
  "data/students.xlsx",
  col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age")
)
```

## Skiping the first row {-}

```{r}
read_excel(
  "data/students.xlsx",
  col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
  skip = 1
)
```

## Dealing with the missing data {-}

```{r}
read_excel(
  "data/students.xlsx",
  col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
  skip = 1,
  na = c("", "N/A")
)
```

## Specify the column types {-}

```{r}
read_excel(
  "data/students.xlsx",
  col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
  skip = 1,
  na = c("", "N/A"),
  col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text", "text", "numeric")
)
```

## Read file and then fix data {-}

```{r}
students <- read_excel(
  "data/students.xlsx",
  col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
  skip = 1,
  na = c("", "N/A"),
  col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text", "text", "text")
)


students



students <- students |>
  mutate(
    age = if_else(age == "five", "5", age),
    age = parse_number(age)
  )


students
```


## Reading worksheets {-}

An important feature that distinguishes spreadsheets from flat files is the notion of multiple sheets.

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-spreadsheets-penguins-islands.png)


## Read single worksheet {-}
You can read a single worksheet from a spreadsheet with the sheet argument in read_excel(). The default, which we’ve been relying on up until now, is the first sheet.

```{r}
read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Torgersen Island")
```


## read_excel with NAs {-}
Some variables that appear to contain numerical data are read in as characters due to the character string "NA" not being recognized as a true NA.

```{r}
penguins_torgersen <- read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Torgersen Island", na = "NA")

penguins_torgersen
```

## excel_sheets for information {-}
Alternatively, we can use **excel_sheets()** to get information on all worksheets in an Excel spreadsheet, and then read the one(s) you’re interested in.

```{r}
excel_sheets("data/penguins.xlsx")
```

Once you know the names of the worksheets, you can read them in individually with read_excel().

```{r}
penguins_biscoe <- read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Biscoe Island", na = "NA")

penguins_dream  <- read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Dream Island", na = "NA")
```

```{r}
dim(penguins_torgersen)

dim(penguins_biscoe)

dim(penguins_dream)

```
## Bind data for single dataframe {-}
We can put them together with bind_rows().

```{r}
penguins <- bind_rows(penguins_torgersen, penguins_biscoe, penguins_dream)

penguins
```



## Reading part of a sheet {-}

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-spreadsheets-deaths.png)

## Example file deaths.xlsx {-}

This spreadsheet is one of the example spreadsheets provided in the readxl package. We can use the readxl_example() function to locate the spreadsheet on your system in the directory where the package is installed. 

```{r}
deaths_path <- readxl_example("deaths.xlsx")

deaths <- read_excel(deaths_path)

deaths
```

## read_excel with range {-}
Here the data we want to read in starts in cell A5 and ends in cell F15. In spreadsheet notation, this is A5:F15, which we supply to the range argument:

```{r}
read_excel(deaths_path, range = "A5:F15")
```


## Data types {-}

In CSV files, all values are strings. This is not particularly true to the data, but it is simple: everything is a string.

The underlying data in Excel spreadsheets is more complex. A cell can be one of four things:

- A boolean, like TRUE, FALSE, or NA.

- A number, like “10” or “10.5”.

- A datetime, which can also include time like “11/1/21” or “11/1/21 3:00 PM”.

- A text string, like “ten”.

## Writing to Excel {-}

```{r}
bake_sale <- tibble(
  item     = factor(c("brownie", "cupcake", "cookie")),
  quantity = c(10, 5, 8)
)


bake_sale
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_xlsx(bake_sale, path = "data/bake-sale.xlsx")
```

- This is how the data look like in excel

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-spreadsheets-bake-sale.png)

## Lost datatypes when reading {-}
Just like reading from a CSV, information on data type is lost when we read the data back in. This makes Excel files unreliable for caching interim results as well. For alternatives, see [Writing to a file](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-import.html#sec-writing-to-a-file)

```{r}
read_excel("data/bake-sale.xlsx")
```

## Formatted output {-}

The writexl package is a light-weight solution for writing a simple Excel spreadsheet, but if you’re interested in additional features like writing to sheets within a spreadsheet and styling, you will want to use the [openxlsx package.](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx) We won’t go into the details of using this package here, but we recommend reading[https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/articles/Formatting.html](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/articles/Formatting.html) 

## Google Sheets {-}

Google Sheets is another widely used spreadsheet program included. It’s free and web-based. Just like with Excel, in Google Sheets data are organized in worksheets (also called sheets) inside of spreadsheet files.

## Prerequisites {-}

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)  
library(tidyverse)  
```

A quick note about the name of the package: googlesheets4 uses v4 of the Sheets API v4 to provide an R interface to Google Sheets, hence the name.

## Getting started with Google Sheets {-}

- The main function of the **googlesheets4 package** is **read_sheet()**, which reads a Google Sheet from a URL or a file id. This function also goes by the name **range_read()**.

- You can create a brand new sheet with **gs4_create()** or write to an existing sheet with **sheet_write()** and friends.

- You can read from a public Google Sheet without authenticating with your Google account and with **gs4_deauth()**.

##  Reading Google Sheets {-}

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/screenshots/import-googlesheets-students.png)
- The first argument to read_sheet() is the URL of the file to read, and it returns a tibble:
```{r gsheets01,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
gs4_deauth()
students_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1nPp1tzOuutXFLb3G9Eyxi3qxeEhnOXUzL5_BcCQ0w"

read_sheet(students_url)

```
## Define datatypes {-}

```{r gsheets02,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
read_sheet(
  students_url,
  col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
  skip = 1,
  na = c("", "N/A"),
  col_types = "dcccc"
)

```

- Note that we defined column types a bit differently here, using short codes. For example, “dcccc” stands for “double, character, character, character, character”.

## Read specific sheet {-}
```{r gsheets03,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
penguins_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aFu8lnD_g0yjF5O-K6SFgSEWiHPpgvFCF0NY9D6LXnY"

read_sheet(penguins_url, sheet = "Torgersen Island")
```

## List of sheets {-}
We can obtain a list of all sheets within a Google Sheet with sheet_names():

```{r gsheets04,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
sheet_names(penguins_url)
```

## Read portion of the sheet {-}

```{r gsheets05,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
deaths_url <- gs4_example("deaths")

read_sheet(deaths_url, range = "A5:F15")

```

## Writing to Google Sheets {-}

We can write from R to Google Sheets with write_sheet(). The first argument is the data frame to write, and the second argument is the name (or other identifier) of the Google Sheet to write to:

```{r gsheets06,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
write_sheet(deaths)
```

## Authentication {-}

While we can read from a public Google Sheet without authenticating with your Google account, reading a private sheet or writing to a sheet requires authentication so that **googlesheets4** can view and manage your Google Sheets. We can check the [googlesheet4 vignette](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/auth.html) on how to setup the your account in R.



## Summary {-}
![](https://media.tenor.com/AAhRO0tvnT0AAAAM/excited-im.gif)


Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets are two of the most popular spreadsheet systems. Being able to interact with data stored in Excel and Google Sheets files directly from R is a superpower! 

- In this chapter we learned how to read data into R from spreadsheets and from Excel with read_excel() from the readxl package and from Google Sheets with read_sheet() from the googlesheets4 package.
