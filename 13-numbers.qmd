## Introduction

- Since we have already learnt about tibbles, in this chapter we will study vectors that underlie them.

### Prerequisites

- Here we focus on base R data structures, hence no need to load any packages.
- But we will a couple of functions from `purrr` package to avoid some inconsistencies in base R.

```{r}

#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)
```

## Vector basics

- There are two types of vectors:
  - Atomic vectors, of which there are six types: 
    - <span style="color: blue;">logical</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">integer</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">double</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">character</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">complex</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">raw</span>
  - Integer and double vectors are collectively called **numeric** vectors.
  - Lists, at times, are called recursive vectors because lists can contain other lists.
- The main difference between vectors and lists:
  - Atomic vectors are homogeneous i.e., contain only one type (in my understanding).
  - Lists are heterogeneous i.e., can have different types.
- Another related object: `NULL`. It is often used to represent the absence of a vector (unlike `NA` which is used to represent the absence of a value). `NULL` typically acts as a vector of length 0.

Figure 20.1: The hierarchy of R’s vector types:

![](images/data-structures-overview.png)

- Two key properties for each vector:
  - Its **type**, which can be determined with `typeof()`.
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-type-of
#| eval: false

typeof(letters)

typeof(1:10)
```

  - Its **length**, which can be determined with `length()`.
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-length-vector
#| eval: false

x1 <- list("a", "b", 1:10); length(x1)

x2 <- c("a", "b"); length(x2)
```

> Qn: does this imply that the length of a list is the # of elements in a list for example (x1)?

- Vectors can also contain arbitrary additional metadata in the form of attributes.
  - Which are then used to create **augmented vectors** which build on additional behaviour. There are three important types of augmented vectors:
    - Factors are built on top of integer vectors.
    - Dates and date-times are built on top of numeric vectors.
    - Data frames and tibbles are built on top of lists.

## Important types of atomic vector

- The four most important types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, and character.

> Note: Raw and complex are rarely used during a data analysis, hence not part of this of discussion.

### Logical

- Simplest type of atomic vector --> can take only three possible values: `FALSE`, `TRUE`, and `NA`.
- They are constructed with comparison operators.
- OR, can create them by hand with `c()`:

```{r}
#| label: 15-logical-vector
#| eval: false

1:10 %% 3 == 0

c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, NA)
```

> Qn: what exactly is %% doing here? I understand is x modulus y...

### Numeric

- As learnt, integer and double are known collectively as numeric vectors.
- In R, numbers are doubles by default.
- To create an integer, place `L` after the number.

```{r}
#| label: 15-numeric-vector
#| eval: false

typeof(1)

typeof(1L)

1.5L
```

> Note: the warning after running 1.5L is because that integers only take whole numbers. I think.

- Two important differences between doubles and integers:
  1. Doubles are approximations. They represent floating point numbers that can't be precisely represented with a fixed amount of memory. Therefore, we should consider all doubles as approximations. E.g., the square root of two:
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-doubles-vector
#| eval: false

(x3 <- sqrt(2) ^ 2)

options(scipen = 999)
x3 - 2
```

> Side note: `options(scipen = 999)` to remove the scientific numbers as I often confuse reading e- or e+.

- When working with floating point numbers, it is common that the calculations include some approximation.
  - Hence, when we compare floating point numbers we should use `dplyr::near()` instead of `==` as it allows for some numerical tolerance. (*what does this mean?*)
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-dplyr-near
#| eval: false

dplyr::near(1.745, 2)
# compares if 1.745 is the same as 2
# FALSE
```

2. Integers have one special value: `NA` while doubles have four: `NA`, `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf`. 
    - `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf` can arise during division:
    
```{r}
#| label: 15-special-missing-val-numeric
#| eval: false

c(-1, 0, 1) / 0
```

  - To check for these special values, let's use the helper functions `is.finite()`, `is.infinite()`, and `is.nan()` instead of using `==`.
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-checking-special-missing-val-numeric
#| eval: false

is.finite(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
is.infinite(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
is.na(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
is.nan(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
```

![](images/special_missing_values_doubles.png)

### Character

- Most complex atomic vector because each element of a character vector is a string, and a string contains an arbitrary amount of data.
- R uses a global string pool.
  - Implying that each unique string is only stored in memory once.
  - And every use of the string points to that representation.
    - This reduces the amount of memory needed by duplicated strings. To see this, let's use `pryr::object_size()`:
    
```{r}
#| label: 15-checking-memory-character
#| eval: false

x <- "This is a reasonably long string."
pryr::object_size(x)

y <- rep(x, 1000)
pryr::object_size(y)
```

`y` doesn’t take up 1,000x as much memory as `x`, because each element of `y` is just a pointer to that same string. 

A pointer is 8 bytes, so 1000 pointers to a 152 B string is 8 * 1000 + 152 = 8.14 kB.

### Missing values

- Each atomic vector has its own missing value:

```{r}
#| label: 15-atomic-vec-missing-value
#| eval: false

NA            # logical

NA_integer_   # integer

NA_real_      # double

NA_character_ # character
```

- But we don't need to know about these different types since we can always use `NA` and it'll be converted to the correct type using the implicit coercion rules.

- **However, there are some functions that are strict about their inputs, so it’s useful to have this knowledge sitting in your back pocket so you can be specific when needed.**

### Exercises

1. Describe the difference between is.finite(x) and !is.infinite(x).

```{r}
#| label: 15-diff-finite-inifinite
#| eval: false

(x <- c(-1/0, 0/0, 1/0, 5, 5L, NA))
is.finite(x)
is.infinite(x)
!is.infinite(x)
```

`is.finite()` function does consider non-missing numeric values to be finite, and `-Inf`, `NaN`,  `Inf` are considered not to be finite.

`is.infinite()` considers only `-Inf` and `Inf` as infinite. Hence, `!is.infinite()` considers `-Inf` and `Inf` to be finite while non-missing numeric values, `NaN`, and `NA` not to be infinite.

2. Read the source code for dplyr::near() (Hint: to see the source code, drop the ()). How does it work?

```{r}
#| label: 15-info-dplyr-near
#| eval: false

dplyr::near()
```

It doesn't check equality as I first thought, but it checks if two numbers are within a certain tolerance (`tol`), usually given as `.Machine$double.eps^0.5`, which is the smallest floating point number that the computer can represent. (Good to know!!)

3. A logical vector can take 3 possible values. How many possible values can an integer vector take? How many possible values can a double take? Use google to do some research.

```{r}
#| label: 15-possible-values-numeric
#| eval: false

help(integer)
help(double)
```

For integers vectors, R uses a 32-bit representation. I.e., it can represent $2^{32}$ different values with the integers. But one of these values is set aside for `NA_integer_`.

```{r}
#| label: 15-max-integer-value
#| eval: false

.Machine$integer.max
.Machine$integer.max + 1L
```

The range of integers values represented in R is $+- 2^{31}-1$. Hence, the maximum integer is $2^{31}-1$ instead of $2^{32}$ because 1 bit is used to represent the sign $(+ -)$ and one value is to represent $NA_integer_$.

An integer greater than that value, R will return `NA` values.

For double vectors, R uses a 64-bit representation, i.e., they can hold up to $2^{64}$ values. But, some of those values are assigned to special values: `-Inf`, `Inf`, `NA_real_`, and `NaN`.

```{r}
#| label: 15-max-idouble-value
#| eval: false

.Machine$double.xmax
```

4. Brainstorm at least four functions that allow you to convert a double to an integer. How do they differ? Be precise.

The difference between conversion of a double to an integer differs in how they deal with the fractional part of the double.

- Round down, towards $-\infty$ i.e., taking the `floor` of a number --> `floor()`.
- Round up, towards $\infty$ i.e., taking the `ceiling` of a number --> `ceiling()`.
- Round towards zero --> `trunc()` and `as.integer()`.
- Round away from zero.
- Round to the nearest integer. If ties exists, then numbers are defined with a fractional part of 0.5?
  - Round half down, towards $-\infty$.
  - Round half up, towards $\infty$
  - Round half towards zero
  - Round half away from zero
  - Round half towards the even integer --> `round()`.
  - Round half towards the odd integer.
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-rounding-double
#| eval: false

tibble(
  x = c(1.8, 1.5, 1.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 
        -0.2, -0.5, -0.8, -1.2, -1.5, -1.8),
  `Round down` = floor(x),
  `Round up` = ceiling(x),
  `Round towards zero` = trunc(x),
  `Nearest, round half to even` = round(x) # 0.5 is rounded to 0
) 
```

5. What functions from the readr package allow you to turn a string into logical, integer, and double vector?

`parse_logical()` parses logical values, which can appear as variations of TRUE/FALSE or 1/0.

```{r}
#| label: 15-parse-logical
#| eval: false

parse_logical(c("TRUE", "FALSE", "1", "0", "true", "t", "NA"))
```

`parse_integer()` parses integer values.

```{r}
#| label: 15-parse-integer
#| eval: false

parse_integer(c("1235", "0134", "NA"))
```

In case of any non-numeric characters in the string such as commas, decimals, `parse_integer()` will throw an error unlike `parse_numeric()` which ignores all the non-numeric characters before or after the first number.

```{r}
#| label: 15-parse-integer-nonnumeric
#| eval: false

parse_integer(c("1000", "$1,000", "10.00"))
```

```{r}
#| label: 15-parse-numeric-nonnumeric
#| eval: false

parse_number(c("1.0", "3.5", "$1,000.00", "NA", "ABCD12234.90", "1234ABC", "A123B", "A1B2C"))
```

## Using atomic vectors

- Let's review some of the important tools for working with the different types of atomic vectors:
  - How to convert from one type to another, and when that happens automatically.
  - How to tell if an object is a specific type of vector.
  - What happens when you work with vectors of different lengths.
  - How to name the elements of a vector.
  - How to pull out elements of interest.
  
### Coercion

- We can coerce or convert one type of vector to another in two ways:

1. Explicit coercion -> call a function like `as.logical()`, `as.integer()`, `as.double()`, or `as.character()`.  Before doing this, check the type of the vector. For example,  you may need to tweak your readr `col_types` specification.

2. Implicit coercion -> use a vector in a specific context that expects a certain type of vector. For example, using a logical vector with a numeric summary function or using a double vector where an integer vector is expected.

- Our focus here will be implicit coercion as explicit coercion is relatively rarely used in data analysis plus easy to understand.
- An important type of implicit coercion: using a logical vector in a numeric context. 
  - `TRUE` is converted to `1` and `FALSE` is converted to `0`. Hence, summing the logical vector is the # of trues and the mean of a logical vector is the proportion of trues.
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-implicit-coerce-logical-to-numeric
#| eval: false

x <- sample(20, 100, replace = TRUE)
y <- x > 10
sum(y)  # how many are greater than 10?

mean(y) # what proportion are greater than 10?
```

Or, some code that relies  on implicit coercion in the opposite direction, from integer to logical:

```{r}
#| label: 15-implicit-coerce-numeric-to-logical
#| eval: false

if (length(x)) {
  # do something
}
```

Here, 0 is converted to `FALSE` and everything else is converted to `TRUE`. For easier understanding of the code, let's be explicit: `length(x) > 0`.

> NOTE1: When we create a vector containing multiple types with `c()`: the most complex type always wins. --> *Aha moment!*

```{r}
#| label: 15-coerce-vector-with-multiple-types
#| eval: false

typeof(c(TRUE, 1L)) #integer wins

typeof(c(1L, 1.5)) #double wins 
#why? Thinking here, because integer is created from a double?

typeof(c(1.5, "a")) #character wins
```

> NOTE2: An atomic vector **can not** only have a mix of different types since the type is a property of the complete vector, not the individual elements. For a mix of multiple types in the same vector, use a list.

### Test functions

- Suppose we want to have different things based on the type of vector:
  - One option is to use `typeof()`.
  - Or, use a test function which returns a `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
    - Not recommended: base R functions -> `is.vector()` and `is.atomic()`.
    - Instead let's use the `is_*` functions provided by purrr , summarised below.
    
![](images/test_functions.png)

### Scalars and recycling rules

- Not only does R implicitly coerce the types of vectors to be compatible, but it also implicitly coerce the length of vectors. 
  - This is called vector **recycling** because the shorter vector is repeated (or recycled) to the same length as the longer vector.
- Mostly useful when we are mixing vectors and "scalars". Note, R doesn't have scalars instead, a single number is a vector of length 1.
  - Since there are no scalars, most built-in functions are **vectorised** meaning that they will operate on a vector of numbers. Hence, such a code will work:
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-scalars
#| eval: false

sample(10) + 100

runif(10) > 0.5
```

- What happens if we add two vectors of different lengths?

```{r}
#| label: 15-adding-vectors-with-lengths-differ
#| eval: false

1:10 + 1:2
```

R expands the shortest vector to the same length as the longest --> recycling. 

But what if the length of the longer is not an integer multiple of the length of the shorter:

```{r}
#| label: 15-adding-vec-with-lengths-differ-not-multiple
#| eval: false

1:10 + 1:3
```

Vector recycling can silently conceal the problem, hence, the vectorised functions in tidyverse will throw errors when recycling anything other than a scalar. We can use `rep()` to do recycling ourselves.

```{r}
#| label: 15-adding-cols-with-lengths-differ
#| eval: false

tibble(x = 1:4, y = 1:2)

tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, 2))

tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, each = 2))
```

### Naming vectors  

- We can name all types of vectors during creation with `c()`:

```{r}
#| label: 15-naming-vec-at-creation
#| eval: false

c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 4)
```

- Or, with `purrr::set_names()`:

```{r}
#| label: 15-naming-vec-using-purrr
#| eval: false

set_names(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```

> Why name vectors? Because are useful in subsetting. 

### Subsetting

- To filter vectors, we use the subsetting function -> `[` and is called like `x[a]`.There are four types of things that you can subset a vector with:

1. A numeric vector containing only integers, and these must either be all positive, all negative, or zero.

Subsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-vec-positive-integers
#| eval: false

x <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
x[c(3, 2, 5)]
```

If we repeat a position, we can actually make a longer output than input:

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-vec-positive-integers1
#| eval: false

x[c(1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 2)]
```

Negative values drop the elements at the specified positions:

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-vec-negative-integers
#| eval: false

x[c(-1, -3, -5)]
```

It’s an error to mix positive and negative values:

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-vec-positive-and-negative-integers
#| eval: false

x[c(1, -1)]
```

The error message mentions subsetting with zero, which returns no values:

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-vec-zero
#| eval: false

x[0]
```

This is useful if we want to create unusual data structures to functions with. (Jon, please expound!)

2. Subsetting with a logical vector keeps all values corresponding to a `TRUE` value; often useful in conjunction with the comparison functions.

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-vec-logical
#| eval: false

x <- c(10, 3, NA, 5, 8, 1, NA)

# All non-missing values of x
x[!is.na(x)]

# All even (or missing!) values of x
x[x %% 2 == 0]
```

3. If you have a named vector, you can subset it with a character vector:

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-named-vec-with-character-vec
#| eval: false

x <- c(abc = 1, def = 2, xyz = 5)
x[c("xyz", "def")]
```

We can also use a character vector to duplicate individual entries.

```{r}
#| label: 15-subset-named-vec-with-character-vec1
#| eval: false

x[c("xyz", "xyz", "def", "def")]
```

4. The simplest type of subsetting is nothing, `x[]`, which returns the complete `x`. This is mostly useful when subsetting matrices (and other high dimensional structures) because we can select all the rows or all the columns, by leaving that index blank. E.g., if `x` is 2d, `x[1, ]` selects the first row and all the columns.

Learn more about the applications of subsetting: “Subsetting” chapter of Advanced R: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html#applications.

An important difference between `[` and `[[` -> `[[` extracts only a single element, and always drops names. Use it whenever we want to make it clear that we're extracting a single item, as in a for loop.

### Exercises

1. What does `mean(is.na(x))` tell you about a vector `x`? What about `sum(!is.finite(x))`?

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.1-is.na-is-is.finite
#| eval: false

x <- c(-Inf, -1, 0, 1, Inf, NA, NaN)
mean(is.na(x))
sum(!is.finite(x))
```

`mean(is.na(x))` calculates the proprtion of missing (`NA`) and not-a-number (`NaN`) values in a vector. The result of 0.286 is equal to 2 / 7 as expected.

`sum(!is.finite(x))` calculates the number of elements in the vector that are equal to missing (`NA`), not-a-number (`NaN`), or infinity (`Inf`).

2. Carefully read the documentation of `is.vector()`. What does it actually test for? Why does `is.atomic()` not agree with the definition of atomic vectors above?

`is.vector()` checks whether an object has no attributes other than names.

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.2-is-vector-true
#| eval: false

is.vector(list(a = 1, b = 2))
```

But any object that has an attribute apart from names is not:

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.2-is-vector-false
#| eval: false

x <- 1:10
attr(x, "something") <- TRUE
is.vector(x)
```

`is.atomic()` explicitly checks whether an object is one of the atomic types (“logical”, “integer”, “numeric”, “complex”, “character”, and “raw”) or NULL.

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.2-is-atomic
#| eval: false

is.atomic(1:10)
is.atomic(list(a = 1))
```

`is.atomic()` will consider objects to be atomic even if they have extra attributes.

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.2-is-atomic-attr
#| eval: false

is.atomic(x)
```

3. Compare and contrast `setNames()` with `purrr::set_names()`.

`setNames()` takes two arguments, a vector to be named and a vector of names to apply to its elements.

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.3-setnames-fn
#| eval: false

setNames(1:4, c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
setNames(nm = c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

`set_names()` has more ways to set names than `setNames()`. We can specify the names the same way as `setNames()`:

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.3-set-names-fn-2
#| eval: false

purrr::set_names(1:4, c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

The names can also be specified as unnamed arguments:

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.3-set-names-fn-3
#| eval: false

purrr::set_names(1:4, "a", "b", "c", "d")
```

`set_names()` will name an object with itself if no `nm` argument is provided (the opposite of `setNames()` behavior).

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.3-set-names-fn-4
#| eval: false

purrr::set_names(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

The main difference between `set_names()` and `setNames()` is that **`set_names()` allows for using a function or formula to transform the existing names.**

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.3-set-names-fn-5
#| eval: false

purrr::set_names(c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3), toupper)

purrr::set_names(c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3), ~toupper(.))
```

`set_names()` function also checks that the length of the names argument is the same length as the vector that is being named, and will raise an error if it is not.

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.3-set-names-fn-6
#| eval: false

purrr::set_names(1:4, c("a", "b"))
```

`setNames()` function will allow the names to be shorter than the vector being named, and will set the missing names to `NA`.

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.4.3-setnames-fn-7
#| eval: false

setNames(1:4, c("a", "b"))
```

4. Create functions that take a vector as input and returns:

  1. The last value. Should you use `[` or `[[`?

  2. The elements at even numbered positions.

  3. Every element except the last value.

  4. Only even numbers (and no missing values).

5. Why is `x[-which(x > 0)]` not the same as `x[x <= 0]`?

6. What happens when you subset with a positive integer that’s bigger than the length of the vector? What happens when you subset with a name that doesn’t exist?

## Recursive vectors (lists)

- Lists can contain other lists implying that are more complex than atomic vectors.
  - Hence, suitable to represent hierarchical or tree-like structures.
- Use `list()` to create lists.

```{r}
#| label: 15-create-lists
#| eval: false

(xl <- list(1, 2, 3))

```

- We use the function `str()` to assess the structure.

```{r}
#| label: 15-str-lists
#| eval: false

str(xl)
dplyr::glimpse(xl)
#seems one and the same thing?
```

- Lists can be named:

```{r}
#| label: 15-naming-lists
#| eval: false

xl_named <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
str(xl_named)
```

- `list()` can contain a mix of objects unlike atomic vectors.

```{r}
#| label: 15-lists-with-mix-objects
#| eval: false

yl <- list("a", 1L, 1.5, TRUE)
str(yl)
```

- Lists can contain other lists!

```{r}
#| label: 15-lists-within-lists
#| eval: false

zl <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
str(zl)
```

### Visualising lists

- Let's see a visual representation of lists. E.g., 

```{r}
#| label: 15-visual-rep-lists
#| eval: false

x1 <- list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
x2 <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
x3 <- list(1, list(2, list(3)))
```

A visual drawing of the lists:

![](./images/visual_rep_lists.PNG)

There are three principles:

1. Lists have rounded corners. Atomic vectors have square corners.

2. Children are drawn inside their parent, and have a slightly darker background to make it easier to see the hierarchy.

3. The orientation of the children (i.e. rows or columns) isn’t important, a row or column orientation are picked to either save space or illustrate an important property in the example. ??

### Subsetting

- We can subset lists using three ways, let's see the example below.

```{r}
#| label: 15-subsetting-lists
#| eval: false

a <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5))
```

1. `[` extracts a sub-list. And the result will always be a list.

```{r}
#| label: 15-str-sublists1
#| eval: false

str(a[1:2])

str(a[4])
```
We can also subset lists with a logical, integer or character vector as seen in vectors.

2. `[[` extracts a single component from a list. It removes a level of hierarchy from the list.

```{r}
#| label: 15-str-sublists2
#| eval: false

str(a[[1]])

str(a[[4]])
```

3. `$` is a shorthand to extract named elements of a list. It works similarly to `[[` except that you don’t need to use quotes.

```{r}
#| label: 15-subsetting-named-lists
#| eval: false

a$a

a[["a"]]
```

- Difference between `[` and `[[` is important for lists:
  - `[[` drills down into the list while `[` returns a new, smaller list. Let's compare the code and output above with the visual shown below.

### Lists of condiments

- Let's discuss an illustration of the difference between `[` and `[[` to solidify our understanding! :)
- Below we see an usual pepper shaker, and let it be our list `x`.

![](./images/list_pepper_ill.PNG)

- `x[1]` is a pepper shaker containing a single pepper packet:

![](./images/list_pepper_ill_subset1.PNG)

`x[2]` would look the same, but would contain the second packet. `x[1:2]` would be a pepper shaker containing two pepper packets.

- `x[[1]]` is:

![](./images/list_pepper_ill_subset2.PNG)

- `x[[1]][[1]]` to get the content of the pepper package:

### Exercises

1. Draw the following lists as nested sets:

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.5.1-draw-lists
#| eval: false

list(list(list(list(list(list(a))))))
list(a, b, list(c, d), list(e, f))
```
To draw pretty a visual diagram, refer to [DiagramR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html) R Package to render [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) diagrams.

But what I have is hand-drawn. Not pretty!! :)

For b:

2. What happens if you subset a tibble as if you’re subsetting a list? What are the key differences between a list and a tibble?

Subsetting a tibble works the same way as a list; a data frame can be thought of as a list of columns. 

The key difference between a list and a tibble -> **all the elements (columns) of a tibble must have the same length (number of rows). Lists can have vectors with different lengths as elements.**

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.5.2-diff-lists-tibbles
#| eval: false

x <- tibble(a = 1:2, b = 3:4)
x[["a"]]
x["a"]
x[1]
x[1, ]
```

## Attributes

- Any vector can contain arbitrary additional metadata through its **attributes**.
  - Can be thought as named list of vectors that can be attached to any object.
- We can get and set individual attribute values with `attr()` or see them all at once with `attributes()`.

```{r}
#| label: 15-attributes
#| eval: false

x <- 1:10
attr(x, "greeting")
attr(x, "greeting") <- "Hi!"
attr(x, "farewell") <- "Bye!"
attributes(x)
```

- Three very important attributes that used to implement fundamental parts of R:
  -  **Names** are used to name the elements of a vector.
  - **Dimensions** (dims, for short) make a vector behave like a matrix or array.
  - **Class** is used to implement the S3 object oriented system.
 
> Note: We have learnt of the names, and we won't discuss matrices in this discussion as matrices aren;t used in this book!

- Class controls how **generic functions** work.
  - Generic functions are key to object programming since they make functions behave differently for different classes of input. The discussion of object programming is covered in details in Advanced R: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#s3
- An example of generic function:

```{r}
#| label: 15-generic-fn
#| eval: false

as.Date
```

- The call to "UseMethod" means that this is a generic function, and it calls a specific **method**, a function, based on the class of the first argument. 

> Note: All methods are functions; not all functions are methods.

- To list all the methods for a generic, use `methods()`:

```{r}
#| label: 15-method-generic-fn
#| eval: false

methods("as.Date")
```

- For example, if `x` is a character vector, `as.Date()` will call `as.Date.character()`; if it’s a factor, it’ll call `as.Date.factor().`
- We can see the specific implementation of a method with `getS3method()`:

```{r}
#| label: 15-implementation-of-method-default
#| eval: false

getS3method("as.Date", "default")
```

```{r}
#| label: 15-implementation-of-method-numeric
#| eval: false

getS3method("as.Date", "numeric")
```

- The most important S3 generic is `print()` -> controls how the object is printed when we type its name at the console.
- Subsetting functions: `[`, `[[` and `$` are other important generics.

## Augmented vectors

- Atomics vectors and lists are building blocks for other important vector types like factors and dates.
  - These are called **augmented vectors** because they are vectors with additional **attributes**, including class.
    - Because augmented vectors have a class, they behave differently to the atomic vector on which they are built.
- Here, we will discuss four important augmented vectors:
  - Factors
  - Dates
  - Date-times
  - Tibbles
  
### Factors

- They are designed to represent categorical data that can take a fixed set of possible values.
- They are built on top of integers and have a levels attribute:

```{r}
#| label: 15-augmented-factors
#| eval: false

x_factor <- factor(c("ab", "cd", "ab"), levels = c("ab", "cd", "ef"))
typeof(x_factor)
attributes(x_factor)
```

### Dates and date-times

- In R, dates are numeric vectors that represent the number of days since 1 January 1970.

```{r}
#| label: 15-augmented-dates
#| eval: false

x_date <- as.Date("1971-01-01")
unclass(x_date)

typeof(x_date)

attributes(x_date)
```
- Dates-times are numeric vectors with class `POSIXct` that represent the # of seconds since 1 January 1970.

> Note: "POSIXct” stands for “Portable Operating System Interface”, calendar time.

```{r}
#| label: 15-augmented-date-time
#| eval: false

x_date_time <- lubridate::ymd_hm("1970-01-01 01:00")
unclass(x_date_time)

typeof(x_date_time)

attributes(x_date_time)
```

The `tzone` attribute is optional--> controls how the time is printed, not what absolute time it refers to.

```{r}
#| label: 15-augmented-date-time-tzone
#| eval: false

attr(x_date_time, "tzone") <- "US/Pacific"
x_date_time

attr(x_date_time, "tzone") <- "US/Eastern"
x_date_time

```

> Qn: how to find the other time zones?

- Another type of date-times called POSIXlt which are built on top of named lists:

```{r}
#| label: 15-augmented-date-time-posixlt
#| eval: false

y_date_time <- as.POSIXlt(x_date_time)
typeof(y_date_time)
attributes(y_date_time)
```

POSIXlts are rare inside the tidyverse. But pop up in base R, because they are needed to extract specific components of a date, like the year or month. 

Since lubridate provides helpers for us to do this instead, we don’t need them. 

POSIXct’s are always easier to work with, so if we have a POSIXlt, we should always convert it to a regular data time `lubridate::as_date_time()`.

### Tibbles

- Tibbles are augmented lists.
  - They have class “tbl_df” + “tbl” + “data.frame”, and names (column) and row.names attributes:
  
```{r}
#| label: 15-augmented-tibbles
#| eval: false

tb <- tibble::tibble(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)
typeof(tb)
attributes(tb)
```

- The difference between a tibble and a list:
  - All the elements of a data frame must be vectors with the same length.
    - All functions that work with tibbles enforce this constraint.
- Traditional data.frames have a very similar structure:

```{r}
#| label: 15-augmented-df
#| eval: false

df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)
typeof(df)
attributes(df)
```

**The main difference is the class**.

The class of tibble includes “data.frame” which means tibbles inherit the regular data frame behaviour by default.

### Exercises

1. What does hms::hms(3600) return? How does it print? What primitive type is the augmented vector built on top of? What attributes does it use?

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.7.1-hms
#| eval: false

(x <- hms::hms(3600))
class(x)

attributes(x)
```

`hms::hms` returns an object of class, and prints the time in “%H:%M:%S” format.

The attributes it uses are **units** and **class**

2. Try and make a tibble that has columns with different lengths. What happens?

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.7.2-1-scalar
#| eval: false

tibble(x = 1, y = 1:5)
```

The "scalar" 1 is recycled to the length of the longer vector.

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.7.2-2-tibbles-cols-diff-lengths
#| eval: false

tibble(x = 1:3, y = 1:4)
```

Creating a tibble with two vectors of different lengths will give an error.

3. Based on the definition above, is it ok to have a list as a column of a tibble?

```{r}
#| label: 15-ex20.7.3-lists-within-tibbles
#| eval: false

tibble(x = 1:3, y = list("a", 1, list(1:3)))
```

Tibbles can have atomic vectors (with additional attributes)of different types: doubles, character, integers, logical, factor, date. Hence, they can have a list vector as long as its the same length!

[1] 2 2 4 4
01:14:08	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Note that for rounding off a 5, the IEC 60559 standard (see also ‘IEEE 754’) is expected to be used, ‘go to the even digit’. Therefore round(0.5) is 0 and round(-1.5) is -2. However, this is dependent on OS services and on representation error (since e.g. 0.15 is not represented exactly, the rounding rule applies to the represented number and not to the printed number, and so round(0.15, 1) could be either 0.1 or 0.2).
