# Dates and times

**Learning objectives:**

-   **Create date** and **datetime** objects.

    -   Create dates and datetimes from **strings.**
    -   Create dates and datetimes from **individual components.**
    -   Create dates and datetimes from **each other.**

-   Work with **datetime components.**

    -   **Extract** components from datetimes.
    -   **Round** datetime components.
    -   **Set** individual datetime components.

-   Perform **arithmetic** on **timespans.**

    -   Use **durations** to measure exact seconds.
    -   Use **periods** to measure human units like weeks and months.
    -   Use **intervals** to represent timespans with exact start and end datetimes.

-   Recognize ways to deal with **timezones** in R.

## Create date and date-time objects

**From strings:**

-   Date: use 'y' 'm' 'd' in whatever order eg. ymd()
-   Date-time: add 'h' 'm' 's' after an underscore eg. ymd_hms()

**From individual components:**

-   make_date()
-   make_datetime()

**From an existing object:**

-   as_datetime()
-   as_date()

## Work with date-time components

**Extract components from datetimes**

-   year()
-   month()
-   yday()
-   mday()
-   wday()
-   hour()
-   minute()
-   second()

**Round datetime components**

-   floor_date() rounds down
-   ceiling_date() rounds up
-   round_date() rounds to

**Set individual datetime components**

Use create functions (ymd_hms) or update()

## Perform arithmetic on timespans

**Use durations to measure timespans**

Durations measure seconds, be aware conversions happen at a standard rate

-   dseconds()
-   dminutes()
-   dhours()
-   ddays()
-   dwekks()
-   dyears()

These can be added, subtracted and divided in some cases, also multiplied by numbers.

**Use periods to measure human units like weeks or months**

These work like durations, but take into account things like DST

-   seconds()
-   minutes()
-   hours()
-   days()
-   weeks()
-   months()
-   years()

These can be added, subtracted and divided in some cases, also multiplied by numbers.

**Use intervals to represent timespans with exact start and end datetimes**

Intervals are way to do arithmetic with durations and periods? syntax???

## Time zones

**Names**

-   R uses IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) for time zone names.
-   Get a complete list with OlsonNames()

**Change the displayed time zone**

-   The time zone attribute of a datetime is only displayed.
-   UTC is the default (and doesn't have DST, which makes computing easier)
-   with_tz()

**Change the underlying time zone**

-   force_tz()

00:17:21	Sandra Muroy:	Hi Lucus!
00:17:52	lucus w:	Hi Sandra
00:27:34	Ryan Metcalf:	The “Visual Markdown Editor” icon Becki mentioned is intended to provide a similar experience to Jupyter Notebooks.
00:41:39	Federica Gazzelloni:	round_date:: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/round_date.html
00:51:22	lucus w:	Dates and time are HARD
00:51:40	Sandra Muroy:	agree!
00:52:21	Ryan Metcalf:	For a list of timezone abbreviations in R, run `OlsonNames(tzdir = NULL)`
00:53:16	Sandra Muroy:	thanks Ryan!
00:58:51	Ryan Metcalf:	I learned a trick from Federica….for syntax questions, use “?`<the character in question>`” Note the back ticks to highlight the sequence of character.
01:06:13	lucus w:	“?” -- aka “what the”
01:07:42	Federica Gazzelloni:	?`%--%`
01:08:42	Federica Gazzelloni:	start %--% end
01:10:08	Becki R. (she/her):	Thanks, Federica! The easiest answer is the best.
01:10:54	lucus w:	In healthcare there’s a tendency to deidentify date time objects as it’s considered patient identified information. Masking those date time randomly is a huge challenge
01:11:19	Sandra Muroy:	interesting
01:13:57	Sandra Muroy:	happy holidays everyone!
