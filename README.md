# R4DS R for Data Science Book Club

Welcome to the R4DS R for Data Science Book Club!
This is a new experimental repository, separate from the [main R4DS R4DS repository](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-R_for_Data_Science).

We are working together to read [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
Join the #book_club-r_for_data_science channel on the [R4DS Slack](https://r4ds.io/join) to participate.
As we read, we are producing [notes about the book](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-r4ds/).

## Meeting Schedule

2. Fork this repository.
3. Create a New Project in RStudio using your fork.
4. Create a New Branch in your fork for your work.
5. Edit the appropriate chapter file. Use `##` to indicate new slides (new sections).
6. If you use any packages that are not already in the `DESCRIPTION`, add them. You can use `usethis::use_package("myCoolPackage")` to add them quickly!
