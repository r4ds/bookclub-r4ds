## Introduction

- Since we have already learnt about tibbles, in this chapter we will study vectors that underlie them.

### Prerequisites

- Here we focus on base R data structures, hence no need to load any packages.
- But we will a couple of functions from `purrr` package to avoid some inconsistencies in base R.

```{r load_tidyverse, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE} 
library(tidyverse)
```

## Vector basics

- There are two types of vectors:
  - Atomic vectors, of which there are six types: 
    - <span style="color: blue;">logical</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">integer</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">double</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">character</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">complex</span>
    - <span style="color: blue;">raw</span>
  - Integer and double vectors are collectively called **numeric** vectors.
  - Lists, at times, are called recursive vectors because lists can contain other lists.
- The main difference between vectors and lists:
  - Atomic vectors are homogeneous i.e., contain only one type (in my understanding).
  - Lists are heterogeneous i.e., can have different types.
- Another related object: `NULL`. It is often used to represent the absence of a vector (unlike `NA` which is used to represent the absence of a value). `NULL` typically acts as a vector of length 0.

Figure 20.1: The hierarchy of R’s vector types:

![](images/data-structures-overview.png)

- Two key properties for each vector:
  - Its **type**, which can be determined with `typeof()`.
  
```{r type_of, eval=FALSE}
typeof(letters)

typeof(1:10)
```

  - Its **length**, which can be determined with `length()`.
  
```{r length_vector, eval=FALSE}
x1 <- list("a", "b", 1:10); length(x1)

x2 <- c("a", "b"); length(x2)
```

> Qn: does this imply that the length of a list is the # of elements in a list for example (x1)?

- Vectors can also contain arbitrary additional metadata in the form of attributes.
  - Which are then used to create **augmented vectors** which build on additional behaviour. There are three important types of augmented vectors:
    - Factors are built on top of integer vectors.
    - Dates and date-times are built on top of numeric vectors.
    - Data frames and tibbles are built on top of lists.

## Important types of atomic vector

- The four most important types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, and character.

> Note: Raw and complex are rarely used during a data analysis, hence not part of this of discussion.

### Logical

- Simplest type of atomic vector --> can take only three possible values: `FALSE`, `TRUE`, and `NA`.
- They are constructed with comparison operators.
- OR, can create them by hand with `c()`:

```{r logical_vector, eval=FALSE}
1:10 %% 3 == 0

c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, NA)
```

> Qn: what exactly is %% doing here? I understand is x modulus y...

### Numeric

- As learnt, integer and double are known collectively as numeric vectors.
- In R, numbers are doubles by default.
- To create an integer, place `L` after the number.

```{r numeric_vector, eval=FALSE}
typeof(1)

typeof(1L)

1.5L
```

> Note: the warning after running 1.5L is because that integers only take whole numbers. I think.

- Two important differences between doubles and integers:
  1. Doubles are approximations. They represent floating point numbers that can't be precisely represented with a fixed amount of memory. Therefore, we should consider all doubles as approximations. E.g., the square root of two:
  
```{r doubles_vector, eval=FALSE}
(x3 <- sqrt(2) ^ 2)

options(scipen = 999)
x3 - 2
```

> Side note: `options(scipen = 999)` to remove the scientific numbers as I often confuse reading e- or e+.

- When working with floating point numbers, it is common that the calculations include some approximation.
  - Hence, when we compare floating point numbers we should use `dplyr::near()` instead of `==` as it allows for some numerical tolerance. (*what does this mean?*)
  
```{r dplyr_near, eval=FALSE}
dplyr::near(1.745, 2)
# compares if 1.745 is the same as 2
# FALSE
```

2. Integers have one special value: `NA` while doubles have four: `NA`, `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf`. 
    - `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf` can arise during division:
    
```{r special_missing_val_numeric, eval=FALSE}
c(-1, 0, 1) / 0
```

  - To check for these special values, let's use the helper functions `is.finite()`, `is.infinite()`, and `is.nan()` instead of using `==`.
  
```{r checking_special_missing_val_numeric, eval=FALSE}
is.finite(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
is.infinite(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
is.na(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
is.nan(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
```

![](images/special_missing_values_doubles.png)

### Character

- Most complex atomic vector because each element of a character vector is a string, and a string contains an arbitrary amount of data.
- R uses a global string pool.
  - Implying that each unique string is only stored in memory once.
  - And every use of the string points to that representation.
    - This reduces the amount of memory needed by duplicated strings. To see this, let's use `pryr::object_size()`:
    
```{r checking_memory_character, eval=FALSE}
x <- "This is a reasonably long string."
pryr::object_size(x)

y <- rep(x, 1000)
pryr::object_size(y)
```

`y` doesn’t take up 1,000x as much memory as `x`, because each element of `y` is just a pointer to that same string. 

A pointer is 8 bytes, so 1000 pointers to a 152 B string is 8 * 1000 + 152 = 8.14 kB.

### Missing values

- Each atomic vector has its own missing value:

```{r atomic_vec_missing_value, eval=FALSE}
NA            # logical

NA_integer_   # integer

NA_real_      # double

NA_character_ # character
```

- But we don't need to know about these different types since we can always use `NA` and it'll be converted to the correct type using the implicit coercion rules.

- **However, there are some functions that are strict about their inputs, so it’s useful to have this knowledge sitting in your back pocket so you can be specific when needed.**

### Exercises

1. Describe the difference between is.finite(x) and !is.infinite(x).

```{r diff_finite_inifinite, eval=FALSE}
(x <- c(-1/0, 0/0, 1/0, 5, 5L, NA))
is.finite(x)
is.infinite(x)
!is.infinite(x)
```

`is.finite()` function does consider non-missing numeric values to be finite, and `-Inf`, `NaN`,  `Inf` are considered not to be finite.

`is.infinite()` considers only `-Inf` and `Inf` as infinite. Hence, `!is.infinite()` considers `-Inf` and `Inf` to be finite while non-missing numeric values, `NaN`, and `NA` not to be infinite.

2. Read the source code for dplyr::near() (Hint: to see the source code, drop the ()). How does it work?

```{r info_dplyr_near, eval=FALSE}
dplyr::near()
```

It doesn't check equality as I first thought, but it checks if two numbers are within a certain tolerance (`tol`), usually given as `.Machine$double.eps^0.5`, which is the smallest floating point number that the computer can represent. (Good to know!!)

3. A logical vector can take 3 possible values. How many possible values can an integer vector take? How many possible values can a double take? Use google to do some research.

```{r possible_values_numeric, eval=FALSE}
help(integer)
help(double)
```

For integers vectors, R uses a 32-bit representation. I.e., it can represent $2^{32}$ different values with the integers. But one of these values is set aside for `NA_integer_`.

```{r max_integer_value, eval=FALSE}
.Machine$integer.max
.Machine$integer.max + 1L
```

The range of integers values represented in R is $+- 2^{31}-1$. Hence, the maximum integer is $2^{31}-1$ instead of $2^{32}$ because 1 bit is used to represent the sign $(+ -)$ and one value is to represent $NA_integer_$.

An integer greater than that value, R will return `NA` values.

For double vectors, R uses a 64-bit representation, i.e., they can hold up to $2^{64}$ values. But, some of those values are assigned to special values: `-Inf`, `Inf`, `NA_real_`, and `NaN`.

```{r max_idouble_value, eval=FALSE}
.Machine$double.xmax
```

4. Brainstorm at least four functions that allow you to convert a double to an integer. How do they differ? Be precise.

The difference between conversion of a double to an integer differs in how they deal with the fractional part of the double.

- Round down, towards $-\infty$ i.e., taking the `floor` of a number --> `floor()`.
- Round up, towards $\infty$ i.e., taking the `ceiling` of a number --> `ceiling()`.
- Round towards zero --> `trunc()` and `as.integer()`.
- Round away from zero.
- Round to the nearest integer. If ties exists, then numbers are defined with a fractional part of 0.5?
  - Round half down, towards $-\infty$.
  - Round half up, towards $\infty$
  - Round half towards zero
  - Round half away from zero
  - Round half towards the even integer --> `round()`.
  - Round half towards the odd integer.
  
```{r rounding_double, eval=FALSE}
tibble(
  x = c(1.8, 1.5, 1.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 
        -0.2, -0.5, -0.8, -1.2, -1.5, -1.8),
  `Round down` = floor(x),
  `Round up` = ceiling(x),
  `Round towards zero` = trunc(x),
  `Nearest, round half to even` = round(x) # 0.5 is rounded to 0
) 
```

5. What functions from the readr package allow you to turn a string into logical, integer, and double vector?

`parse_logical()` parses logical values, which can appear as variations of TRUE/FALSE or 1/0.

```{r parse_logical, eval=FALSE}
parse_logical(c("TRUE", "FALSE", "1", "0", "true", "t", "NA"))
```

`parse_integer()` parses integer values.

```{r parse_integer, eval=FALSE}
parse_integer(c("1235", "0134", "NA"))
```

In case of any non-numeric characters in the string such as commas, decimals, `parse_integer()` will throw an error unlike `parse_numeric()` which ignores all the non-numeric characters before or after the first number.

```{r parse_integer_nonNumeric, eval=FALSE}
parse_integer(c("1000", "$1,000", "10.00"))
```

```{r parse_numeric_nonNumeric, eval=FALSE}
parse_number(c("1.0", "3.5", "$1,000.00", "NA", "ABCD12234.90", "1234ABC", "A123B", "A1B2C"))
```

## Using atomic vectors

- Let's review some of the important tools for working with the different types of atomic vectors:
  - How to convert from one type to another, and when that happens automatically.
  - How to tell if an object is a specific type of vector.
  - What happens when you work with vectors of different lengths.
  - How to name the elements of a vector.
  - How to pull out elements of interest.
  
### Coercion

- We can coerce or convert one type of vector to another in two ways:

1. Explicit coercion -> call a function like `as.logical()`, `as.integer()`, `as.double()`, or `as.character()`.  Before doing this, check the type of the vector. For example,  you may need to tweak your readr `col_types` specification.

2. Implicit coercion -> use a vector in a specific context that expects a certain type of vector. For example, using a logical vector with a numeric summary function or using a double vector where an integer vector is expected.

- Our focus here will be implicit coercion as explicit coercion is relatively rarely used in data analysis plus easy to understand.
- An important type of implicit coercion: using a logical vector in a numeric context. 
  - `TRUE` is converted to `1` and `FALSE` is converted to `0`. Hence, summing the logical vector is the # of trues and the mean of a logical vector is the proportion of trues.
  
```{r implicit_coerce_logical_to_numeric, eval=FALSE}
x <- sample(20, 100, replace = TRUE)
y <- x > 10
sum(y)  # how many are greater than 10?

mean(y) # what proportion are greater than 10?
```

Or, some code that relies  on implicit coercion in the opposite direction, from integer to logical:

```{r implicit_coerce_numeric_to_logical, eval=FALSE}
if (length(x)) {
  # do something
}
```

Here, 0 is converted to `FALSE` and everything else is converted to `TRUE`. For easier understanding of the code, let's be explicit: `length(x) > 0`.

> NOTE1: When we create a vector containing multiple types with `c()`: the most complex type always wins. --> *Aha moment!*

```{r coerce_vector_with_multiple_types, eval=FALSE}
typeof(c(TRUE, 1L)) #integer wins

typeof(c(1L, 1.5)) #double wins 
#why? Thinking here, because integer is created from a double?

typeof(c(1.5, "a")) #character wins
```

> NOTE2: An atomic vector **can not** only have a mix of different types since the type is a property of the complete vector, not the individual elements. For a mix of multiple types in the same vector, use a list.

### Test functions

- Suppose we want to have different things based on the type of vector:
  - One option is to use `typeof()`.
  - Or, use a test function which returns a `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
    - Not recommended: base R functions -> `is.vector()` and `is.atomic()`.
    - Instead let's use the `is_*` functions provided by purrr , summarised below.
    
![](images/test_functions.png)

### Scalars and recycling rules

- Not only does R implicitly coerce the types of vectors to be compatible, but it also implicitly coerce the length of vectors. 
  - This is called vector **recycling** because the shorter vector is repeated (or recycled) to the same length as the longer vector.
- Mostly useful when we are mixing vectors and "scalars". Note, R doesn't have scalars instead, a single number is a vector of length 1.
  - Since there are no scalars, most built-in functions are **vectorised** meaning that they will operate on a vector of numbers. Hence, such a code will work:
  
```{r scalars, eval=FALSE}
sample(10) + 100

runif(10) > 0.5
```

- What happens if we add two vectors of different lengths?

```{r adding_vectors_with_lengths_differ, eval=FALSE}
1:10 + 1:2
```

R expands the shortest vector to the same length as the longest --> recycling. 

But what if the length of the longer is not an integer multiple of the length of the shorter:

```{r adding_vec_with_lengths_differ_not_multiple, eval=FALSE}
1:10 + 1:3
```

Vector recycling can silently conceal the problem, hence, the vectorised functions in tidyverse will throw errors when recycling anything other than a scalar. We can use `rep()` to do recycling ourselves.

```{r adding_cols_with_lengths_differ, eval=FALSE}
tibble(x = 1:4, y = 1:2)

tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, 2))

tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, each = 2))
```

### Naming vectors  

- We can name all types of vectors during creation with `c()`:

```{r naming_vec_at_creation, eval=FALSE}
c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 4)
```

- Or, with `purrr::set_names()`:

```{r naming_vec_using_purrr, eval=FALSE}
set_names(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```

> Why name vectors? Because are useful in subsetting. 

### Subsetting

- To filter vectors, we use the subsetting function -> `[` and is called like `x[a]`.There are four types of things that you can subset a vector with:

1. A numeric vector containing only integers, and these must either be all positive, all negative, or zero.

Subsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:

```{r subset_vec_positive_integers, eval=FALSE}
x <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
x[c(3, 2, 5)]
```

If we repeat a position, we can actually make a longer output than input:

```{r subset_vec_positive_integers1, eval=FALSE}
x[c(1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 2)]
```

Negative values drop the elements at the specified positions:

```{r subset_vec_negative_integers, eval=FALSE}
x[c(-1, -3, -5)]
```

It’s an error to mix positive and negative values:

```{r subset_vec_positive_and negative_integers, eval=FALSE}
x[c(1, -1)]
```

The error message mentions subsetting with zero, which returns no values:

```{r subset_vec_zero, eval=FALSE}
x[0]
```

This is useful if we want to create unusual data structures to functions with. (Jon, please expound!)

2. Subsetting with a logical vector keeps all values corresponding to a `TRUE` value; often useful in conjunction with the comparison functions.

```{r subset_vec_logical, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(10, 3, NA, 5, 8, 1, NA)

# All non-missing values of x
x[!is.na(x)]

# All even (or missing!) values of x
x[x %% 2 == 0]
```

3. If you have a named vector, you can subset it with a character vector:

```{r subset_named_vec_with_character_vec, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(abc = 1, def = 2, xyz = 5)
x[c("xyz", "def")]
```

We can also use a character vector to duplicate individual entries.

```{r subset_named_vec_with_character_vec1, eval=FALSE}
x[c("xyz", "xyz", "def", "def")]
```

4. The simplest type of subsetting is nothing, `x[]`, which returns the complete `x`. This is mostly useful when subsetting matrices (and other high dimensional structures) because we can select all the rows or all the columns, by leaving that index blank. E.g., if `x` is 2d, `x[1, ]` selects the first row and all the columns.

Learn more about the applications of subsetting: “Subsetting” chapter of Advanced R: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html#applications.

An important difference between `[` and `[[` -> `[[` extracts only a single element, and always drops names. Use it whenever we want to make it clear that we're extracting a single item, as in a for loop.

### Exercises

1. What does `mean(is.na(x))` tell you about a vector `x`? What about `sum(!is.finite(x))`?

```{r ex20.4.1_is.na_is_is.finite, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(-Inf, -1, 0, 1, Inf, NA, NaN)
mean(is.na(x))
sum(!is.finite(x))
```

`mean(is.na(x))` calculates the proprtion of missing (`NA`) and not-a-number (`NaN`) values in a vector. The result of 0.286 is equal to 2 / 7 as expected.

`sum(!is.finite(x))` calculates the number of elements in the vector that are equal to missing (`NA`), not-a-number (`NaN`), or infinity (`Inf`).

2. Carefully read the documentation of `is.vector()`. What does it actually test for? Why does `is.atomic()` not agree with the definition of atomic vectors above?

`is.vector()` checks whether an object has no attributes other than names.

```{r ex20.4.2_is_vector_TRUE, eval=FALSE}
is.vector(list(a = 1, b = 2))
```

But any object that has an attribute apart from names is not:

```{r ex20.4.2_is_vector_FALSE, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
attr(x, "something") <- TRUE
is.vector(x)
```

`is.atomic()` explicitly checks whether an object is one of the atomic types (“logical”, “integer”, “numeric”, “complex”, “character”, and “raw”) or NULL.

```{r ex20.4.2_is_atomic, eval=FALSE}
is.atomic(1:10)
is.atomic(list(a = 1))
```

`is.atomic()` will consider objects to be atomic even if they have extra attributes.

```{r ex20.4.2_is_atomic_attr, eval=FALSE}
is.atomic(x)
```

3. Compare and contrast `setNames()` with `purrr::set_names()`.

`setNames()` takes two arguments, a vector to be named and a vector of names to apply to its elements.

```{r ex20.4.3_setNames_fn, eval=FALSE}
setNames(1:4, c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
setNames(nm = c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

`set_names()` has more ways to set names than `setNames()`. We can specify the names the same way as `setNames()`:

```{r ex20.4.3_set_names_fn_2, eval=FALSE}
purrr::set_names(1:4, c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

The names can also be specified as unnamed arguments:

```{r ex20.4.3_set_names_fn_3, eval=FALSE}
purrr::set_names(1:4, "a", "b", "c", "d")
```

`set_names()` will name an object with itself if no `nm` argument is provided (the opposite of `setNames()` behavior).

```{r ex20.4.3_set_names_fn_4, eval=FALSE}
purrr::set_names(c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
```

The main difference between `set_names()` and `setNames()` is that **`set_names()` allows for using a function or formula to transform the existing names.**

```{r ex20.4.3_set_names_fn_5, eval=FALSE}
purrr::set_names(c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3), toupper)

purrr::set_names(c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3), ~toupper(.))
```

`set_names()` function also checks that the length of the names argument is the same length as the vector that is being named, and will raise an error if it is not.

```{r ex20.4.3_set_names_fn_6, eval=FALSE}
purrr::set_names(1:4, c("a", "b"))
```

`setNames()` function will allow the names to be shorter than the vector being named, and will set the missing names to `NA`.

```{r ex20.4.3_setNames_fn_7, eval=FALSE}
setNames(1:4, c("a", "b"))
```

4. Create functions that take a vector as input and returns:

  1. The last value. Should you use `[` or `[[`?

  2. The elements at even numbered positions.

  3. Every element except the last value.

  4. Only even numbers (and no missing values).

5. Why is `x[-which(x > 0)]` not the same as `x[x <= 0]`?

6. What happens when you subset with a positive integer that’s bigger than the length of the vector? What happens when you subset with a name that doesn’t exist?

## Recursive vectors (lists)

- Lists can contain other lists implying that are more complex than atomic vectors.
  - Hence, suitable to represent hierarchical or tree-like structures.
- Use `list()` to create lists.

```{r create_lists, eval=FALSE}
(xl <- list(1, 2, 3))

```

- We use the function `str()` to assess the structure.

```{r str_lists, eval=FALSE}
str(xl)
dplyr::glimpse(xl)
#seems one and the same thing?
```

- Lists can be named:

```{r naming_lists, eval=FALSE}
xl_named <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
str(xl_named)
```

- `list()` can contain a mix of objects unlike atomic vectors.

```{r lists_with_mix_objects, eval=FALSE}
yl <- list("a", 1L, 1.5, TRUE)
str(yl)
```

- Lists can contain other lists!

```{r lists_within_lists, eval=FALSE}
zl <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
str(zl)
```

### Visualising lists

- Let's see a visual representation of lists. E.g., 

```{r visual_rep_lists, eval=FALSE}
x1 <- list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
x2 <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
x3 <- list(1, list(2, list(3)))
```

A visual drawing of the lists:

![](./images/visual_rep_lists.PNG)

There are three principles:

1. Lists have rounded corners. Atomic vectors have square corners.

2. Children are drawn inside their parent, and have a slightly darker background to make it easier to see the hierarchy.

3. The orientation of the children (i.e. rows or columns) isn’t important, a row or column orientation are picked to either save space or illustrate an important property in the example. ??

### Subsetting

- We can subset lists using three ways, let's see the example below.

```{r subsetting_lists, eval=FALSE}
a <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5))
```

1. `[` extracts a sub-list. And the result will always be a list.

```{r str_sublists1, eval=FALSE}
str(a[1:2])

str(a[4])
```
We can also subset lists with a logical, integer or character vector as seen in vectors.

2. `[[` extracts a single component from a list. It removes a level of hierarchy from the list.

```{r str_sublists2, eval=FALSE}
str(a[[1]])

str(a[[4]])
```

3. `$` is a shorthand to extract named elements of a list. It works similarly to `[[` except that you don’t need to use quotes.

```{r subsetting_named_lists, eval=FALSE}
a$a

a[["a"]]
```

- Difference between `[` and `[[` is important for lists:
  - `[[` drills down into the list while `[` returns a new, smaller list. Let's compare the code and output above with the visual shown below.
  
![](./images/subsetting_lists.PNG)

### Lists of condiments

- Let's discuss an illustration of the difference between `[` and `[[` to solidify our understanding! :)
- Below we see an usual pepper shaker, and let it be our list `x`.

![](./images/list_pepper_ill.PNG)

- `x[1]` is a pepper shaker containing a single pepper packet:

![](./images/list_pepper_ill_subset1.PNG)

`x[2]` would look the same, but would contain the second packet. `x[1:2]` would be a pepper shaker containing two pepper packets.

- `x[[1]]` is:

![](./images/list_pepper_ill_subset2.PNG)

- `x[[1]][[1]]` to get the content of the pepper package:

![](./images/list_pepper_ill_subset3.PNG)

### Exercises

1. Draw the following lists as nested sets:

```{r ex20.5.1_draw_lists, eval = FALSE}
list(list(list(list(list(list(a))))))
list(a, b, list(c, d), list(e, f))
```
To draw pretty a visual diagram, refer to [DiagramR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html) R Package to render [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) diagrams.

But what I have is hand-drawn. Not pretty!! :)

2. What happens if you subset a tibble as if you’re subsetting a list? What are the key differences between a list and a tibble?

Subsetting a tibble works the same way as a list; a data frame can be thought of as a list of columns. 

The key difference between a list and a tibble -> **all the elements (columns) of a tibble must have the same length (number of rows). Lists can have vectors with different lengths as elements.**

```{r ex20.5.2_diff_lists_tibbles, eval=FALSE}
x <- tibble(a = 1:2, b = 3:4)
x[["a"]]
x["a"]
x[1]
x[1, ]
```

## Attributes

- Any vector can contain arbitrary additional metadata through its **attributes**.
  - Can be thought as named list of vectors that can be attached to any object.
- We can get and set individual attribute values with `attr()` or see them all at once with `attributes()`.

```{r attributes, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
attr(x, "greeting")
attr(x, "greeting") <- "Hi!"
attr(x, "farewell") <- "Bye!"
attributes(x)
```

- Three very important attributes that used to implement fundamental parts of R:
  -  **Names** are used to name the elements of a vector.
  - **Dimensions** (dims, for short) make a vector behave like a matrix or array.
  - **Class** is used to implement the S3 object oriented system.
 
> Note: We have learnt of the names, and we won't discuss matrices in this discussion as matrices aren;t used in this book!

- Class controls how **generic functions** work.
  - Generic functions are key to object programming since they make functions behave differently for different classes of input. The discussion of object programming is covered in details in Advanced R: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#s3
- An example of generic function:

```{r generic_fn, eval=FALSE}
as.Date
```

- The call to "UseMethod" means that this is a generic function, and it calls a specific **method**, a function, based on the class of the first argument. 

> Note: All methods are functions; not all functions are methods.

- To list all the methods for a generic, use `methods()`:

```{r method_generic_fn, eval=FALSE}
methods("as.Date")
```

- For example, if `x` is a character vector, `as.Date()` will call `as.Date.character()`; if it’s a factor, it’ll call `as.Date.factor().`
- We can see the specific implementation of a method with `getS3method()`:

```{r implementation_of_method_default, eval=FALSE}
getS3method("as.Date", "default")
```

```{r implementation_of_method_numeric, eval=FALSE}
getS3method("as.Date", "numeric")
```

- The most important S3 generic is `print()` -> controls how the object is printed when we type its name at the console.
- Subsetting functions: `[`, `[[` and `$` are other important generics.

## Augmented vectors

- Atomics vectors and lists are building blocks for other important vector types like factors and dates.
  - These are called **augmented vectors** because they are vectors with additional **attributes**, including class.
    - Because augmented vectors have a class, they behave differently to the atomic vector on which they are built.
- Here, we will discuss four important augmented vectors:
  - Factors
  - Dates
  - Date-times
  - Tibbles
  
### Factors

- They are designed to represent categorical data that can take a fixed set of possible values.
- They are built on top of integers and have a levels attribute:

```{r augmented_factors, eval=FALSE}
x_factor <- factor(c("ab", "cd", "ab"), levels = c("ab", "cd", "ef"))
typeof(x_factor)
attributes(x_factor)
```

### Dates and date-times

- In R, dates are numeric vectors that represent the number of days since 1 January 1970.

```{r augmented_dates, eval=FALSE}
x_date <- as.Date("1971-01-01")
unclass(x_date)

typeof(x_date)

attributes(x_date)
```
- Dates-times are numeric vectors with class `POSIXct` that represent the # of seconds since 1 January 1970.

> Note: "POSIXct” stands for “Portable Operating System Interface”, calendar time.

```{r augmented_date_time, eval=FALSE}
x_date_time <- lubridate::ymd_hm("1970-01-01 01:00")
unclass(x_date_time)

typeof(x_date_time)

attributes(x_date_time)
```

The `tzone` attribute is optional--> controls how the time is printed, not what absolute time it refers to.

```{r augmented_date_time_tzone, eval=FALSE}
attr(x_date_time, "tzone") <- "US/Pacific"
x_date_time

attr(x_date_time, "tzone") <- "US/Eastern"
x_date_time

```

> Qn: how to find the other time zones?

- Another type of date-times called POSIXlt which are built on top of named lists:

```{r augmented_date_time_POSIXlt, eval=FALSE}
y_date_time <- as.POSIXlt(x_date_time)
typeof(y_date_time)
attributes(y_date_time)
```

POSIXlts are rare inside the tidyverse. But pop up in base R, because they are needed to extract specific components of a date, like the year or month. 

Since lubridate provides helpers for us to do this instead, we don’t need them. 

POSIXct’s are always easier to work with, so if we have a POSIXlt, we should always convert it to a regular data time `lubridate::as_date_time()`.

### Tibbles

- Tibbles are augmented lists.
  - They have class “tbl_df” + “tbl” + “data.frame”, and names (column) and row.names attributes:
  
```{r augmented_tibbles, eval=FALSE}
tb <- tibble::tibble(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)
typeof(tb)
attributes(tb)
```

- The difference between a tibble and a list:
  - All the elements of a data frame must be vectors with the same length.
    - All functions that work with tibbles enforce this constraint.
- Traditional data.frames have a very similar structure:

```{r augmented_df, eval=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)
typeof(df)
attributes(df)
```

**The main difference is the class**.

The class of tibble includes “data.frame” which means tibbles inherit the regular data frame behaviour by default.

### Exercises

1. What does hms::hms(3600) return? How does it print? What primitive type is the augmented vector built on top of? What attributes does it use?

```{r ex20.7.1_hms, eval=FALSE}
(x <- hms::hms(3600))
class(x)

attributes(x)
```

`hms::hms` returns an object of class, and prints the time in “%H:%M:%S” format.

The attributes it uses are **units** and **class**

2. Try and make a tibble that has columns with different lengths. What happens?

```{r ex20.7.2_1_scalar, eval=FALSE}
tibble(x = 1, y = 1:5)
```

The "scalar" 1 is recycled to the length of the longer vector.

```{r ex20.7.2_2_tibbles_cols_diff_lengths, eval=FALSE}
tibble(x = 1:3, y = 1:4)
```

Creating a tibble with two vectors of different lengths will give an error.

3. Based on the definition above, is it ok to have a list as a column of a tibble?

```{r ex20.7.3_lists_within_tibbles, eval=FALSE}
tibble(x = 1:3, y = list("a", 1, list(1:3)))
```

Tibbles can have atomic vectors (with additional attributes)of different types: doubles, character, integers, logical, factor, date. Hence, they can have a list vector as long as its the same length!
